ERR
# EXPECT (ERROR CASE)
# - Intent: Indentation must be consistent (e.g., 4 spaces per level). A 2-space indent after a 4-space indent is illegal.
- Primary error message should mention: "mixed indentation width" or "inconsistent indent".
- Span should highlight: the leading spaces of the line `beta`.
- Recovery: Lexer should either treat `beta` as invalid indent and continue, or stop�note which behavior your spec requires.
