ERR
# EXPECT (ERROR CASE)
# - Intent: Reject underscores in numeric literals (except the N_M pick shorthand).
- Primary error message should mention: "invalid number literal" or "numeric separator not allowed".
- Span should highlight: the underscore region in each bad number.
- Recovery: Lexer continues so later lines are still tokenized (note if your impl stops).
