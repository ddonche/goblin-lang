ERR
# EXPECT (ERROR CASE)
# - Intent: Reject invalid escapes in non-raw strings.
- Primary error message should mention: "bad escape" or "invalid escape".
- Span should highlight: the backslash + following chars for each bad escape (`\q`, `\u12G4`, `\u123`).
- Recovery: Lexer continues after reporting; remaining lines/tokenization proceed normally (note if your impl stops).
