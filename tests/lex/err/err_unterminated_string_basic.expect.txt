ERR
# EXPECT (ERROR CASE)
# - Intent: Detect missing closing quote for a basic double-quoted string.
- Primary error message should mention: "unterminated string" or "expected closing quote".
- Span should highlight: from the opening quote in `name = "Alice` through the end of line (or to EOF).
- Recovery: Lexer should continue so that `next = 42` is still lexed normally (if recovery is supported).
