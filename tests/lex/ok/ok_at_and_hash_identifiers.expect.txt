# EXPECT
# - Intent: `@policy` lexes as AT_IDENT; `#balance` lexes as HASH_IDENT. Keywords remain keywords.
- Key behaviors: 
  - `set` ? KEYWORD(set); `@policy` ? AT_IDENT("@policy"); `Billing` ? IDENT.
  - `class`/`end` ? KEYWORDs; inside, `#balance` ? HASH_IDENT followed by `=` NUMBER.
- Notes: No class semantics asserted here�this is purely a lexing shape check.
