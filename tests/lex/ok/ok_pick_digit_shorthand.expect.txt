# EXPECT
# - Intent: `NUMBER '_' NUMBER` lexes as PICK_DIGIT_SHORTHAND; optional modifiers are recognized.
- Key behaviors:
  - `5_4`, `3_2`, `2_8` ? PICK_DIGIT_SHORTHAND.
  - `unique` lexes as KEYWORD(unique).
  - `!dups` lexes as `!` followed by KEYWORD(dups).
- Notes: No randomness semantics here�pure token shapes per v1.18.
