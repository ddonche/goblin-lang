# EXPECT
# - Intent: Cover most operator/punct token shapes with minimal context.
- Key behaviors:
  - Longest-match: `...` over `..`; `::` as single token; `?.` and `??` as distinct tokens.
  - Postfix forms present (`9++`, `16//`) alongside infix forms.
  - Join operators `|` and `||`, pipeline `|>`, arrow `->`, and `@` punct are recognized.
  - Comparison families `==`, `!=`, `<=`, `>=`, and strict `===`, `!==`.
  - Words `is` / `is not` appear as their specified operator tokens.
- Notes: This is a **lexing shape** check only�no evaluation semantics.
