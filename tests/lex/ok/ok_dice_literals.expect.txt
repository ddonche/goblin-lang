# EXPECT
# - Intent: Dice notation tokenizes as DICE_LITERAL in typical contexts.
- Key behaviors:
  - `3d6`, `4d6+2`, `1d200-100` ? DICE_LITERAL.
  - `roll` / `roll_detail` are KEYWORDs that commonly precede dice, but the literal shape is lexical.
- Notes: No evaluation semantics here�pure token shapes per v1.18.
